### Data Description

For the purpose of this project, a Netflix dataset sourced from Kaggle has been used.


```r
df <- read.csv("netflix_titles.csv", stringsAsFactors = F) # read data

summary(df) # summary statistics
```

The original dataset consists of 7787 rows and 12 columns. All columns excluding 'show_id' and 'title' had unique values less than 7787, which is the total number of rows of this Netflix dataset. This indicates presence of duplicates in those columns. Also, many blank - "" - values has been found in 'director','cast','country','date_added', and 'rating' columns.

Cleaning all misleading values at once will lead to major data loss. In order to prevent data biases, pre-processing for this dataset will be done to a minimum. Cleaning will only be done on columns in use.

### Visualization

In this section, only relevant columns will be pre-processed, then be used for creating visualizations. Pre-processing methodologies will be discussed under each analysis topic. 


#### Netflix trends by year

This section will investigate the Netflix trend in their contents addition by year - regardless of contents release date. Note that a movie released in 2017 can be added on Netflix in 2020. How many movies and TV shows they add to their platform each year? Does Netflix treat movies and TV shows differently?

The 'date_added' column was originally in 'month day, year' format as character type. Therefore, it has been converted to numeric 'year' for yearly trend analysis. Missing values in 'date_added' also has been removed for the purpose of this analysis.


```r
# To investigate yearly trends, I need to eliminate Month and Day data from 'date_added' column
head(df$date_added,5) # this column is originally in 'Month Day, Year' format
```

```
## [1] "August 14, 2020"   "December 23, 2016" "December 20, 2018"
## [4] "November 16, 2017" "January 1, 2020"
```

```r
class(df$date_added) # column class: character
```

```
## [1] "character"
```

```r
df$date_added <- sub(".*(\\d+{4}).*$", "\\1", df$date_added) # convert date to year
head(df$date_added,5) # this column now only has year data
```

```
## [1] "2020" "2016" "2018" "2017" "2020"
```

```r
# total number of movies and TV shows added to Netflix by year

  filter(!(date_added == "")) %>% # remove missing values
  group_by(date_added) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) # number of movies and TV shows by year added to Netflix
year
```

First bar plot shows the total number of movies and TV shows added on Netflix by year. After years of adding more contents each year, Netflix finally added less number of contents to its platform in 2020.

Second chart compares its trend in movies to that of TV shows. Although the number of movies added to Netflix outnumbers that of TV shows on Netflix, it started to show a decrease in 2020, whereas number of TV shows added has continued to increase. This may be an indication of Netflix focusing more on TV shows.


#### Movie vs TV show

This section will show total number of movies and TV shows on Netflix.


```r
# create data frame for number of contents by type
type <- df %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
type
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   type    count
##   <chr>   <int>
## 1 Movie    5377
## 2 TV Show  2410
```

```r
#all plots created afterwards will have title at center
#theme_update(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 

# create bar plot for Netflix contents by type
bar <- ggplot(type, aes(x = type, y = count, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = -0.3) +
  labs(title = "Netflix contents by type", x = "Type", fill = "Type") + # add title
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # center title
bar
```

![](Netflix-Analysis_files/figure-html/type-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
# create data frames each for movies and TV shows for further analysis
movie <- df[(df$type == "Movie"),]
tv <- df[(df$type == "TV Show"),]
```

As shown in the chart above, the number of movies on Netflix is more than double the number of TV shows.

For further analysis on each content type, the dataset has been split down into two separate datasets based on the 'type' column.


#### Netflix Movie Analysis

The remaining of this project will examine movies on Netflix. The dataset 'movie' that has been created above will be used.


#### Top 10 Countries by number of movies on Netflix

In order to identify top 10 countries by number of movies, the 'country' column has been pre-processed. Originally, there were some movies that has listed multiple countries as their origin - for example, the movie '100 meters' had 'Portugal, Spain' in its 'country' column. This created too many unique values for 'country' column. Therefore, I split the country name value whenever there was a comma in between them, and removed the comma and unnecessary blank spaces. At the end, I was able to retrieve clean list of country names.

1) Bar plot

```r
# basic information about movies on Netflix
length(unique(movie$country)) # country column has many duplicates
```

```
## [1] 591
```

```r
head(movie$country, 50) # some movies has listed multiple countries separated by comma
```

#### Number of movies by Year

This section will study Netflix's preference for country of origin for movies. This will be done by creating a line graph for number of movies from 5 countries by year. Note that it uses movies' date added on Netflix for the time variable. This study has no relation to the amount of movie production done in each country.

The line graph above shows the number of movies added on Netflix by year for 5 different countries. The country legends on the right enables select and deselect - you can only look at the countries you want. While the number of movies from all 5 countries are on a downturn recently, the graph suggests that Netflix has been adding less number of Indian movies on their platform since 2018, as opposed to 2019 for American and British film and 2020 for French and Canadian film.


#### Netflix movie genre trends by year

This section will research Netflix movie genre trends by examining which genre has been the most popular in which year. I will use 'listed in' column for genre and 'date_added' for date of movies added on Netflix.

Similar pre-processing methodology for 'country' column will be used for 'listed in' column. The genre values in 'listed in' column will be split down at commas. After cleaning, there was a total of 20 genre.

I will create 2 bar charts - an interactive stacked bar chart for comparison of changes of one genre over time and a static percentage stacked bar chart

First graph is stacked bar chart for all genre by year. You can de-select all but one to see one genre's change over time.

Second graph is the percentage stacked barchart for Netflix movie genre. The graph clearly illustrates Netflix having more variety of genre in their movie collection. In addition, the percentage of international and LGBTQ movie genre - bar in light blue color on the graph -  has been increasing since 2014. This clearly indicates that Netflix has been putting a lot of effort in promoting diversity in their film collection over time.


#### Movie genre popularity in Top 5 countries by number of movies on Netflix

First and second chart shows the distribution of movie genre in top 5 countries. Among the five countries, very large portion of French and Indian movies were categorized as international movies on Netflix. Only a small amount of American movies has been categorized as international film, and this all come down to the fact that Netflix originated from United States. In addition, France and India - two countries Netflix identified as foreign - showed weaker genre diversity on Netflix compared to United States. Therefore, increasing genre diversity in foreign movies on Netflix may be the next step Netflix will make within the next few years.
